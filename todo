Remy Sharp: Build Anything (in HTML 5)
  http://speakerdeck.com/u/rem/p/build-anything

  Interesting Stuff:
    - <!DOCTYPE html>
    - native JSON parsing
    - Web storage
    - History API
    - Appcache
    - EventSource (http://jsconsole.com/) - polyfillable
    - Drag and Drop files - attach it to a dom element, add some event listeners...tada


Jake Archibald: Appcache
  http://speakerdeck.com/u/jaffathecake/p/application-cache-douchebag
  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2501978/appcache-diagram.svg

  Interesting Stuff:
    - Works for later versions of Chrome, FF, Opera, and IE(10), IOS, Android
    - Offline access
    - Do stuff sites vs. Get stuff sites

    - To add: <html manifest="offline.appcache"
              add files you want cached to the manifest
              serve manifest with CONTENT-TYPE:cache-manifest
    - Lots of caveats
      once you specify, the only way you'll get changes is if you update the manifest (versions, comments, etc.)
      4xx/5xx/redirects to another domain? no caching at all
      cache validation woes
      dealing with stale content (which is why you see "New version of Google xxx now available.  Reload?")
      doesn't like stuff that's not appcached (add NETWORK section to appcache for everything else)

    - offlining get stuff sites needs to be opt-in; more caveats
      show online content when available
      indicate which content is available offline, let user decide, one page with all offline views (with iframe...:()
      use localstorage for optional offline

Paul Irish: JS Tooling

  - Quote (Paul Irish):
    No developer wants to be spinning their wheels, or operating on mundane tasks when thy could instead be creating rich and compelling experiences.  Smart developers work with smart tools, effective workflows, and wise strategies for development.
